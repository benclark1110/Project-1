<!-- With your group, answer each of the following questions:

Who is your target audience? -- Anyone between ages of 15-30
What is the problem that the product will address? -- Allowing this program to select your music for you so you dont have to decide.  Potentially introducing you to new music
What is the primary goal of the product? -- Fun way to listen to a new playlist
Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)? -- 1 - Get API calls working, 2 - Design Layout, 3 - Hook in with firebase
Remember, your MVP should be the absolute minimum product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
As a user, I want to be able to view other people’s images so that I can keep up with what’s happening in their lives.
Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren’t essential. They should not be part of the MVP. -->
